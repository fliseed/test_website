1,therapy_benefits,Therapy Benefits,Lukas Freais,21/02/2024,"<p>In honor of Mental Health Awareness Month (May), I have decided to share my script for my TEDx Talk about therapy and its benefits. Below, you’ll find a slightly modified version of it.</p>
<p><br/>
When you hear the word “therapy”, what’s your reaction? I want you to think about that for a moment. Do you think “Yeah therapy is awesome!”? Or are you more like “Ugh, this again.” Are you somewhere in between? Well, I’m here to tell you that we should all go to therapy. Now, when I say therapy,Ingredients: 1 cup All-Purpose Flour 1 teaspoon Baking Powder ⅛ teaspoon Salt 2 Large Eggs (room temperature) 1 Large Egg Yolk (room temperature) cup Granulated Sugar 1 tablespoon Vegetable Oil 1 teaspoon Vanilla Extract 6 tablespoon Unsalted Butter 1 cup Semi-Sweet Chocolate Chips (plus some for topping cookies) ¼ cup Unsweetened Cocoa Powder 1 teaspoon Espresso Powder (optional) Sea Salt Flakes (for topping cookies (optional garnish)) Instructions: Adjust the oven rack to the 2nd level mark (just above center) and preheat your oven to 350ºF. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone mats. Set to the side. In a medium bowl, whisk together the all-purpose flour, baking powder, and salt. Set to the side. Using a hand mixer or stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat the eggs, egg yolk, granulated sugar, vegetable oil, and vanilla extract together on medium-high speed until fully combined and frothy. Meanwhile, in a small saucepan, heat the semi-sweet chocolate chips and unsalted butter together over medium heat until fully melted and smooth. Remove from heat and immediately whisk or stir in the unsweetened cocoa powder and espresso powder. Carefully pour the melted chocolate mixture into the wet ingredients and mix until the chocolate is just combined. Add in the whisked dry ingredients and mix on low speed until just combined. You can also simply fold in the dry ingredients using a spatula. The batter will be on the thinner side, but still scoopable. Using a 1 ½ tablespoon-size cookie scoop or 2 spoons, scoop the cookie dough out and place onto the baking sheets, leaving about 1 ½ inches of space between them. Advice: Make sure to leave space between the dough balls when placing them onto the baking sheets. Depending on the size of the balls, the cookies will become quite big and they may merge while in the oven. Sprinkle some sea salt flakes over the top of each cookie, then bake for 8-10 minutes at 350ºF or until the tops of the cookies have a shiny, crackly top to them. Remove from the oven and top with a few additional chocolate chips (optional). You can also choose to use a round cookie cutter to shape them into perfect round cookies. Do this immediately after they have come out of the oven while they're still soft. Let the cookies cool on the baking sheets for about 5 minutes before transferring them to a cooling rack to cool almost completely—because they are really good while warm! Use a spatula to transfer the cookies because they will be very soft! Cookies are best kept in a sealed food container at room temperature for up to 2 days.

Credits: https://beyondthebutter.com/salted-brownie-cookies/, but you may not all have had a session with a therapist before, so I’m just gonna explain what it entails.<br/>
<br/>
Concretely, psychotherapy is a treatment that helps people with a myriad of different mental health conditions and emotional difficulties, but what it boils down to is you talking with a licensed therapist or psychiatrist who will listen and converse with you as well as help you learn coping mechanisms depending on what you’re struggling with. It’s important to note that there are MANY types of psychotherapy. Some examples are cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) which is identifying and finding alternatives to unhealthy behaviors (and is what I personally do), dialectical behavioral therapy which is a type of CBT that is rooted in emotions, interpersonal therapy, psychodynamic therapy, psychoanalysis, supportive therapy, etc. Some of you might believe in therapy and its importance, but others may hear the word and cringe or become uncomfortable, which is of course an opinion you’re entitled to, but my goal is to change your attitude through this talk.<br/>
<br/>
This aversion to it is very much rooted in the historical perception of therapy. While certain forms of psychotherapy have existed for a very long time, it was more formally “invented” in the early 1800s. Even so, therapy was very much a taboo subject, and to some people or in some parts of the world still is. Historically people who had genuine mental health issues were often diagnosed with female hysteria (for women specifically) or other degrading and false diagnoses, receiving lobotomies, and being subjected to a number of other very inhuman procedures. In the 19th century, therapists were called alienists which, believe it or not, contributed to the taboo nature of the practice, with the word “alien” coming from French and meaning insane, which you can probably assume did not give therapists the best reputations.<br/>
<br/>
Even today, there are many stereotypes and misconceptions about therapy, even around what it’s used for and for things as simple as where it takes place! A lot of people believe that you go to a therapist’s office, lie down on a couch and just vent about your problems, and while that last part may be accurate in some cases, sessions can take place anywhere. They can be done online while you’re in the comfort of your own home or bed, and if it’s in person, there may be a couch in the therapist’s office but you aren’t required to lie on it, you can just sit!<br/>
Psychotherapy is also commonly seen as a necessity to “fix” an illness but, as I said, there are many types of therapy that have different goals.<br/>
<br/>
There are people who struggle with mental health and don’t (or simply can’t) get treatment. In the US, according to Mental Health America, “19.86% of adults[, nearly 50 million Americans,] are experiencing a mental illness [and] 4.91% [of them] are experiencing a severe mental illness.” Now, you might be saying, “Well I’m not an adult so I’m good!”, but from 2016 to 2019, 20 million people between the ages of 3 and 17 were diagnosed with either depression, anxiety, ADHD, or a behavioral disorder. What’s more, research shows that in 2022, almost 19% of teenagers in the US reported having seriously considered committing suicide, and in that same year, “over 20% of children with depression did not receive any treatment, [while] over 40% of children with anxiety received no treatment” (CDC). Some people may even have mental health imposter syndrome, which means that they don&#x27;t feel like they deserve to go to therapy because their problems “aren’t big enough” even if they impact them. Therapy is a way of guiding people who are struggling with their mental health instead of leaving them to deal with them on their own.<br/>
<br/>
That lack of help can have fatal consequences. According to the Depression and Bipolar Support Alliannce, “ [t]he lifetime risk of suicide among patients with untreated depressive disorder is nearly 20%.” In the US, “[s]uicide is the second-leading cause of death for teens and young adults, ages 10-34” (CDC, 2022), while being “the fourth leading cause of death among 15-29 year-olds” in the world (WHO, 2019). However, people considering suicide aren’t alone. Psychotherapy is proven to help with depression and suicidal ideation, with a study by Frontiers (that was published in the National Library of Medicine) demonstrating how it helps with suicide prevention. Their review of observational studies showed methods of psychotherapy, mostly DBT and CBT, help decrease the risk of suicide “in patients with a diagnosis of borderline personality disorder (32.5%) and depression (15.0%)”, with suicidal ideation being reduced by 55% and suicide attempts going down 37.5%.<br/>
<br/>
Finally, some of you may not have anything you need help with but you don’t have to have a “big problem” or a severe mental illness to go to therapy! Even without one, it can be very beneficial. According to Dr. Gail Saltz, a professor of psychiatry, “[p]lenty of people […] come to therapy to understand themselves better, to work through areas that are more difficult, and to improve their ability to thrive and cope with adversity. [...] [She]’d say that often it would be best for people to seek therapy long before the crisis occurs in their life so they would be better equipped to manage the inevitable crisis or difficulty in their lives.”<br/>
Especially after the COVID-19 pandemic, considering therapy is really important. Even if you didn’t lose anyone or weren’t particularly affected by it, at least 3 million people died and basically everyone had to stay isolated, which can definitely have an effect on a person’s mental health, whether it be big or small. In 2021, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration found that “69.1% of 12-17 year olds perceived that the COVID-19 pandemic negatively affected their mental health.”<br/>
Therapy doesn’t only help you in the moment, it can also help you in the long-term. By developing healthy coping mechanisms, support systems, learning about yourself and your mental health, you have all the tools to deal with situations that you might be confronted with later in life. 75% of people who go to therapy benefit from it and when they are done with their sessions, individuals see their mental health symptoms get 80% better than for people who did not go to therapy (APA). And so, with the enormous benefits that psychotherapy can give us, we should all stop seeing it as taboo or bad so that everyone can benefit from it without shame because no one should feel alone in their struggles with mental health or be made to be guilty for getting the help that they need and deserve.<br/>

2,bake_sale,Bake Sale,Stella Orapy,12/02/2024,"<p>In December of 2022, on a regular school day, Sofia approached me with an idea: a bake sale to raise money for the Trevor Project. Coincidentally, I had been thinking about a similar project for a few months at the time. Together, we started working on the project and met with Melyssa, the school’s CPE, to discuss how we were going to put it in place.<br/>
<br/>
This is how the Trevor Project bake sale started. A collaboration between us, two Premiere students who simply wanted to put out a little kindness into the world. Soon enough, the project became a group project of the class, and even the school, with students from Seconde, Premiere and Terminale, as well as incredible AED Lauren all getting involved in promoting the project, baking, and selling the goods.<br/>
<br/>
For any reader who might not know, the Trevor Project is a non-for-profit organization founded in 1998. The goals of the project are to provide crisis intervention and suicide prevention services for LGBTQ+ youth (people under 25), as well as to offer guidance and resources to parents and educators in order to foster safe, accepting, and inclusive environments for all youth.<br/>
<br/>
We wanted to fundraise for this organization because we believe that it is important to do our part in society and give back to the 2SLGBTQ+ community. It is also a way of recognizing that although most people in our community are generally accepted by their loved ones and live in healthy, supportive environments, many in the world do not have that privilege.<br/>
<br/>
To encourage people to participate in the project, posters were put around the school by Lauren. We also gave a presentation during a Vie de classe to 1ere Jade a few weeks before the bake sale. Students could then sign up on a Google Doc or at Vie Scolaire if they wanted to bake or volunteer to sell on the day of the bake sale.<br/>
<br/>
The bake sale symbolically took place on February 14th, being Valentine’s Day. It started at 8:00 in the morning in the parking lot of the LFT, and then moved inside of the building, in front of Vie Scolaire and in the basement. Baked goods were sold during breaks (10:12 to 10:27AM and 1:53 to 2:08PM) and during both lunch hours.<br/>
<br/>
Overall, the bake sale was very successful: we raised $557 in total! We especially want to thank Melyssa for encouraging everyone to participate in the project and always defending our interests. Thank you to Lauren for being the best ever (as always), to all the students who baked goods even though, as most of us know, the workload tends to keep us busy, and to those who stuck out in the cold and at every break to dedicate their time to this noble cause. We whole-heartedly believe that this kind of event shows how powerful our community is when we come together to do something for the greater good.<br/>
<br/>
All the love,<br/>
Sofia and Chloe</p>

3,best_cookie_recipe,Best Cookie Recipe,Plaus Fraser,04/05/2024,"<p>
Ingredients:

1 cup All-Purpose Flour
1 teaspoon Baking Powder
⅛ teaspoon Salt
2 Large Eggs (room temperature)
1 Large Egg Yolk (room temperature)
cup Granulated Sugar
1 tablespoon Vegetable Oil
1 teaspoon Vanilla Extract
6 tablespoon Unsalted Butter
1 cup Semi-Sweet Chocolate Chips (plus some for topping cookies)
¼ cup Unsweetened Cocoa Powder
1 teaspoon Espresso Powder (optional)
Sea Salt Flakes (for topping cookies (optional garnish))

Instructions:

Adjust the oven rack to the 2nd level mark (just above center) and preheat your oven to 350ºF. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone mats. Set to the side.
In a medium bowl, whisk together the all-purpose flour, baking powder, and salt. Set to the side.
Using a hand mixer or stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat the eggs, egg yolk, granulated sugar, vegetable oil, and vanilla extract together on medium-high speed until fully combined and frothy.
Meanwhile, in a small saucepan, heat the semi-sweet chocolate chips and unsalted butter together over medium heat until fully melted and smooth. Remove from heat and immediately whisk or stir in the unsweetened cocoa powder and espresso powder.
Carefully pour the melted chocolate mixture into the wet ingredients and mix until the chocolate is just combined.
Add in the whisked dry ingredients and mix on low speed until just combined. You can also simply fold in the dry ingredients using a spatula. The batter will be on the thinner side, but still scoopable.
Using a 1 ½ tablespoon-size cookie scoop or 2 spoons, scoop the cookie dough out and place onto the baking sheets, leaving about 1 ½ inches of space between them.
Advice: Make sure to leave space between the dough balls when placing them onto the baking sheets. Depending on the size of the balls, the cookies will become quite big and they may merge while in the oven.
Sprinkle some sea salt flakes over the top of each cookie, then bake for 8-10 minutes at 350ºF or until the tops of the cookies have a shiny, crackly top to them.
Remove from the oven and top with a few additional chocolate chips (optional). You can also choose to use a round cookie cutter to shape them into perfect round cookies. Do this immediately after they have come out of the oven while they're still soft.
Let the cookies cool on the baking sheets for about 5 minutes before transferring them to a cooling rack to cool almost completely—because they are really good while warm! Use a spatula to transfer the cookies because they will be very soft!
Cookies are best kept in a sealed food container at room temperature for up to 2 days.
